# Key Concepts Covered

## Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs)
- ZKPs allow a prover (Peggy) to prove knowledge of a secret to a verifier (Victor) without revealing the secret itself.
- **Color-Blind Verifier Example**: Demonstrates how Peggy can prove she knows the difference between two colored balls without revealing the colors to Victor.
- **Where's Wally Example**: Shows how Peggy can prove she found Wally in a picture without disclosing Wally's location.

## Group Theory
- Explores sets equipped with a single operation that satisfies certain axioms (closure, associativity, identity, and invertibility).
- **Closure**: The operation on any two elements of the group produces another element within the same group.
- **Associativity**: The way in which elements are grouped during the operation does not change the result.
- **Identity**: There exists an element in the group that, when used in the operation with any element of the group, results in that element.
- **Invertibility**: For every element in the group, there exists another element that, when combined with the operation, results in the identity element.

## Polynomials
- Mathematical expressions consisting of variables and coefficients, involving sums of powers of the variables.
- **Operations**: Includes addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of polynomials.
- **Roots of a Polynomial**: Values of the variable that make the polynomial equal to zero.
- **Degree of a Polynomial**: The highest power of the variable in the polynomial.
- **Lagrange Interpolation**: A method for constructing a polynomial that passes through a given set of points.

## Modular Arithmetic
- A system of arithmetic for integers, where numbers "wrap around" upon reaching a certain value—known as the modulus.
- **Importance**: Fundamental in cryptography for operations like encrypting and decrypting messages, and generating digital signatures.

## Elliptic Curves
- Curves defined over a finite field that follow a specific cubic equation, used in cryptography for efficient and secure key generation and digital signatures.
- **Security**: Provides the same level of security as RSA with shorter keys, making operations faster and more efficient.
- **Application**: Essential in blockchain technology for creating digital signatures and securing transactions.

## Fermat's Little Theorem
- A theorem stating that if `p` is a prime number, then for any integer `a` not divisible by `p`, `a^(p-1) ≡ 1 (mod p)`.
- **Application**: Used to find multiplicative inverses in modular arithmetic, crucial for algorithms in public-key cryptography.

## Encryption
- **Symmetric Encryption**: Uses the same key for both encryption and decryption, ideal for encrypting large volumes of data efficiently.
- **Asymmetric Encryption**: Uses a pair of keys (public and private) for encryption and decryption, suitable for secure key exchange and digital signatures.
- **Use Cases**: Symmetric encryption is used for bulk data encryption, while asymmetric encryption is used for secure communication channels and digital signatures.
